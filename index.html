        <h1>About Me</h1><br>
        <p>
            As a graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in Modelling in Simulation at the <a href="https://www.diat.ac.in/" target="_blank">Defense Institute of Advanced 
            Technology</a>, Pune, I have developed a strong foundation in Statistics, Machine Learning, and Data Analysis, making 
            me an ideal candidate for a career in data-driven roles.<br><br>
            Hailing from Agra, Uttar Pradesh, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the <a href="https://www.dei.ac.in/dei/" target="_blank">Dayalbagh 
            Educational Institute</a>, Agra. However, upon realizing my interest and potential in mathematics and statistics, I 
            started seeking roles that aligned with my interests, ultimately leading me to pursue a Master's degree in Modelling in 
            Simulation (School of Computer Engineering & Mathematical Sciences).<br><br>
            During my academic career, I have gained proficiency in programming languages such as Python and SQL, and have 
            also gained hands-on experience in the <a href="https://www.tropmet.res.in/" target="_blank">Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology</a>, Pune, where I sharpened my 
            technical skills and understood the importance of effective communication and teamwork in data-driven decision 
            making.<br><br>
            I am excited about the potential for data science to make a significant impact on businesses and society and is 
            eager to collaborate with experienced professionals in the field to contribute to solving complex problems using 
            data-driven approaches. I am a quick learner, analytical thinker, and possess strong work ethics.<br><br>
            As a constant learner, I am committed to staying at the forefront of this rapidly-evolving field and are open to 
            learning new skills, taking on new challenges, and continuously improving my skills to become a valuable asset to 
            any team. With my strong academic background and practical experience through internshhips and projects, I am 
            well-equipped to excel in any data-driven role.
